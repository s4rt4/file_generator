## üöÄ Getting Started

This is a static web project. No complex installation or build steps are required.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/s4rt4/file_generator.git](https://github.com/s4rt4/file_generator.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd file_generator
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    * Simply open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.
    * For the best experience (especially ensuring icon paths and the file-opening logic work correctly), run it through a local server. If you have Python installed, you can run:
        ```bash
        # For Python 3
        python -m http.server
        ```
        Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
